I fill in what is to be found where:

=====

1. h-Set is a saturated category.

have in Coq:
  precategory_of_hsets.v
	is_saturated_HSET

2. If D is saturated, then so is Fun(C, D).

have in Coq:
  precategories.v  
	is_saturated_functor_category

3. As a corollary: Fun(C^op, h-Set) is a saturated category.

have when have 2

4. Define the Yoneda embedding y: C ---> Fun(C^op, h-Set) by y(c) =
Hom(-, c) and prove that it is full and faithful.

have in Coq:
  yoneda.v
	yoneda_fully_faithful

5. A full subcategory of a saturated category is again saturated.

have in Coq:
   precategories.v
	is_saturated_full_subcat

6. Define a predicate on objects of Fun(C^op, h-Set): is_representable(F)
:= isinhab(exists c : ob(C), Iso(y(c), F)).

all necessary defs already in Coq

7. Define a full subcategory S(C) of Fun(C^op, h-Set) given by the
predicate is_representable.

all necessary defs already in Coq

8. By 5. we get that S(C) is saturated.

nothing to do

9. We have the induced map Y : C ---> S(C). This map is full and faithful
by the Yoneda Lemma and it is essentially surjective by construction.

have in Coq:
  precategory_fun_full_img_fully_faithful_if_fun_is
	precategories.v
  (saying that if F : C -> D is ff, then so is F':C -> Im(F)   )

10. If F : C ---> D is an equivalence of precategories, then the following
type is inhabited: Id(C, D).



11. Combining 9. and 10. we get an inhabitant of Id(C, S(C)).
